dont copy in someone elses question and answer. the idea is to first be sure you understand the concept. then use your skill to construct a good question. Consider what part of the understand is most challenging and hard to remember, or what question will prove you still understand. The question has to be based on your understanding, write the question like you are the master who invented the subject, and write the question for a student
